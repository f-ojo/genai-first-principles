AboutAbout
I'm an independent data and AI scientist, consultant, writer, educator & podcaster. My interests include promoting data & AI literacy/fluency, helping to spread data skills through organizations and society and lowering the barrier to entry for data science, analysis, and machine learning. Previously, I was Head of Developer Relations at Outerbounds, a company committed to building infrastructure that provides a solid foundation for machine learning applications of all shapes and sizes. I am also the host of the industry podcast Vanishing Gradients. I was previously Head of Marketing and Data Science Evangelism at Coiled, building solutions for scalable data science and machine learning in Python. Before this, I was at DataCamp, a data science training company educating over 4 million learners worldwide through interactive courses on the use of Python, R, SQL, Git, Bash and Spreadsheets in a data science context. While there, I spearheaded the development of over 25 courses in DataCamp’s Python curriculum, impacting over 250,000 learners worldwide through my own courses. I hosted and produced the data science podcast DataFramed, in which I used long-format interviews with working data scientists to delve into what actually happens in the space and what impact it can and does have.I'm an independent data and AI scientist, consultant, writer, educator & podcaster.

    🍿 While touring Europe, I want to chat with as many interesting people as possible and bring them to you. First up, meet Utkarsh Kashyap:

    * UK is a software engineer at Outerbounds working on ML/AI infrastructure tools for data scientists and ML/AI engineers 💻 
    * He loves building tools that delight users and enjoys the deep technical challenges that result here 💅 
    * He's excited about all the current challenges faced on the infra side by running and deploying LLMs and other foundational models 🤟 
    * Utkarsh also recently got married so many congrats to him and his wife! 💫 

    If you're at KubeCon EU this week, come say hi at Booth J26 and we can even record a short chat if you'd like! 📺 

PostPost
🇫🇷 Help us find the cat we’ve lost in Paris. Bring any leads to Outerbounds Booth J26 at KubeCon EU. Details in video 🐈 👇🏻

PostPost
🍿 I just caught up with Phillip Carter, Principal PM at honeycomb.io, at KubeCon EU in Paris 🥐 , who

* as Honeycomb's unofficial AI lead, was ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO PUT LLMS IN PRODUCTION 🤯 (outside of the big AI labs)! 🤓 
* loves solving problems that customers really care about and which there isn't such a playbook for; 💫 
* is excited about the possible futures of AI agents, with how good the models are getting, along with composability of models 🤖 

If you're at KubeCon EU or in Paris, London, Berlin, or Amsterdam (among other places in Europe) and want to chat, let me know! 📺

PostPost
🍿 I had the great pleasure of chatting with Gael Varoquaux, a co-founder/OG core dev of scikit-learn 😎 . Gaël

* Started scikit-learn, is a scientist at Inria, and is helping to spin out :probabl.! 🎲 
* Loves using science and software to contribute to the world in a good way, building tools that help others build technology and do science 😍 
* Is excited about better models for survival analysis and their applications in healthcare! 🏥 
* Is also excited about foundation models but concerned about the "bigger is better" worldview and its impact on climate change. 👀 

Gaël is a true legend to me and, although we've interacted over the years, we'd never met IRL, and it was such a pleasure! 🤩 

PostPost
scikit-learn is one of the most boring hashtag#machinelearning packages.

Let me tell you why while standing by the banks of the Seine eating a croissant 🥐 👇🏻

Also join our mixer with our scikit-learn friends at :probabl. tonight!

    🤖 I’m prepping several classes on LLM evaluation for AI products right now. If you’re building in this space, these are the 3 best resources to get started, and I recommend reading them in this order: 1. “Task-Specific LLM Evals that Do & Don’t Work” by Eugene Yan https://lnkd.in/gAXtC5Ka 2. “Your AI Product Needs Evals” by Hamel Husain https://lnkd.in/giDyirNk 3. “Who Validates the Validators? Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences” by Shreya Shankar et al. https://lnkd.in/gk37eWny Read them, internalize the key points, and keep them in mind while building, building, and building. Your AI products will be far better—and you’ll increase your chances of becoming extremely wealthy 🤑, Task-Specific LLM Evals that Do & Don't Work, eugeneyan.com

How do you scale a data science team to 200 over 7 years while embedding analytics and machine learning into a company’s DNA? 📊 Dr. Elena Tej Grewal, Ph.D. did just that at Airbnb, where she built systems to power product decisions, flag risky users, and scale trust in data across teams. By embedding machine learning into fraud detection and other core processes, she laid the foundation for a data-driven culture that scaled with the company. 🎥 In this clip from our new episode of High Signal, Elena shares: • How simple heuristics solved early challenges in fraud detection. • The trade-offs between machine learning models and quick solutions. • Why data principles apply everywhere—even to selling ice cream during cold New England winters. Today, Elena teaches data science at Yale, exploring environmental applications, while running an ice cream shop that thrives on experimentation and insights from data. 🍦 💡 What’s an unconventional place where you’ve applied data insights? Share your experience below! This podcast is produced by Delphina, with Duncan Gilchrist and Jeremy Hermann, and is designed to help you navigate the complex world of AI, data science, and machine learning while advancing your career.

                DataCamp is a Boston-based startup that provides online, interactive training in data science. Founded in 2013, the company participated in TechStars NYC during the spring of 2015, received their first round of VC funding soon after, and now has over 350,000 registered users worldwide.

                At DataCamp, I am responsible for building out the Python curriculum. This involves everything from mapping out long-term curriculum goals to devising courses to (the best part!) working with state-of-the-art instructors from academia, industry and development to build interactive data science courses. We provide instructors the opportunity to significantly expand their reach, influence, and impact, while also supplementing their income through our generous revenue sharing program.

            Hugo is amazing. I am a physician in NYC who is trying to learn more about DataScience. Hugo was my professor for DataScience as part of DataCamp. He is so incredibly articulate and passionate about Python. He made me feel like a true “pythonista”. I can’t say enough great things about him. He is obviously incredibly intelligent and has such deep knowledge of DataScience but also really helps the new student. I end my comment as I began: Hugo is simply amazing. Hugo is amazing.
