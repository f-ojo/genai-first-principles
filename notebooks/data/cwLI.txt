AboutAbout
Chris Wiggins is an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University and the Chief Data Scientist at the New York Times. At Columbia he is a founding member of the Department of Systems Biology, the executive committee of the Data Science Institute (http://datascience.columbia.edu/), and the Institute's education and entrepreneurship committees. He is also an affiliate of Columbia's Department of Statistics and a founding member of Columbia's Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (C2B2). He is a co-founder and co-organizer of hackNY (http://hackNY.org), a nonprofit which since 2010 has organized once a semester student hackathons and the hackNY Fellows Program, a structured summer internship at NYC startups. Prior to joining the faculty at Columbia he was a Courant Instructor at NYU (1998-2001) and earned his PhD at Princeton University (1993-1998) in theoretical physics. In 2014 he was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society and is a recipient of Columbia's Avanessians Diversity Award.Chris Wiggins is an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University and the Chief Data Scientist at the New York Times.

❓ Are Prediction and Machine Learning Enough—Or Should Data Science Aim Higher ❓ In this episode of High Signal, chris wiggins —Chief Data Scientist at The New York Times, professor at Columbia University, Author, Raconteur—explores how data science is evolving beyond prediction to prescribe meaningful interventions that drive real-world impact. Key themes we covered: 🔍 From Prediction to Prescription Chris challenges the status quo: “Prediction isn’t the end game. The real question is: What intervention should we make?” Learn how causal inference and reinforcement learning are converging to answer this. 🛠️ Scaling Data Functions From proofs of concept to production systems, Chris shares the journey of building The New York Times’ world-class data science team and the principles that guided its success. 🤓 Causal Inference Meets Reinforcement Learning Chris highlights how these two fields are converging to solve prescriptive challenges, helping organizations move beyond observation and prediction to deliver real impact. 💻 The Challenges of Integration Building robust data systems isn’t just about advanced models—it’s about aligning technical innovations with organizational maturity. Chris offers advice for scaling from proof-of-concept to production systems that deliver measurable value. 📊 The AI Hierarchy of Needs Why even the most sophisticated AI tools fall short without strong data foundations, reliable pipelines, and well-tested processes. This podcast is produced by Delphina, with Duncan Gilchrist and Jeremy Hermann, and is designed to help you navigate the complex world of AI, data science, and machine learning while advancing your career. 💡 A personal note: I met Chris a decade ago through our shared interest in biophysics research at Columbia. That day he invited me to The New York Times to meet his team, offering a firsthand look at his thoughtful leadership. Since then, he’s been a tremendous supporter, a friend, and a true inspiration in the data science and AI community. 🎧 Don’t miss this conversation.

            Professor Wiggins is the most creative and forward-thinking professor I had at Columbia. Having graduated in 2006, I find his Applied Math seminar uniquely valuable in inspiring my career path. Although finance was the predominant career choice among applied math majors, He opened our minds to wide-ranging fields where modeling and machine learning could be applied. His seminar was always fun and lively. Everyone was encouraged to design and present a research project. In retrospect, this became the starting point where I developed confidence in putting models and data to practical use. Professor Wiggins’ foresight and passion for building applied math communities really helped me start off on the right foot. I’m excited that he is setting trends in data science and education.

            Chris is an enormous asset for The Times: a wonderful and creative collaborator, a natural and caring leader, and a magnet for talent. As Chief Data Scientist, he rapidly built an enormously productive group of razor-sharp data scientists, mentoring and supporting them, plugging them into the company's priority problems to solve, and investing in their careers and development. Several of his team members have themselves already become case-studies for the company on the value of data science as a discipline. Although Chris has been central to setting them up for success, he unfailingly does everything he can to shine the light on them rather than himself.Chris is an enormous asset for The Times: a wonderful and creative collaborator, a natural and caring leader, and a magnet for talent.
