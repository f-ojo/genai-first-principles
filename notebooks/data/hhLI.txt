AboutAbout
I enjoy building tools and platforms to make ML more accessible. I have authored and am a core maintainer of many popular open source tools: https://hamel.dev/oss/opensource.html Furthermore, I have extensive experience (20+ years) as a machine learning engineer across a wide variety of industries.

I am currently helping people operationalize LLM models. I worked on GitHub Copilot, a large language model deployed at scale used by over 100M developers, as well as pre-cursors to Copilot like CodeSearchNet.

I often hear that evals are the most confusing part of creating LLM AI products. It's a shame b/c IMO, domain-specific evals are the most important part of an AI product! I've written a detailed blog post with real examples on how to do this https://lnkd.in/gXf9afPV
Your AI Product Needs Evals –

    i want your strongly held opinions on pgvector vs specialized databases for vector embeddings. at what point do teams switch to specialized alternatives? when is it worth it?
