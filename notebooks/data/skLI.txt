AboutAbout
With over 10 years of experience in building and leading data & ML related systems and teams, I am the co-founder and CEO of DAGWorks, a startup that helps data practitioners with a powerful and flexible framework based on Hamilton, an open source project that I co-created. I am also a Y Combinator alum, StartX alum, and a Stanford graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science with Distinction in Research.

My passion is to make others more successful with data, by bridging the gap between data science, machine learning, engineering, and business. I have expertise in data platforms, model lifecycles, featurization, and model serving systems, as well as in natural language processing, speech recognition, and spoken dialog systems. I am a proficient Python developer and a polymath engineer who can work with multiple languages and technologies. I also contribute to open source projects and advise other startups in the data space. I value good leadership, company culture, and innovation, and I strive to be a humble and effective leader who empowers and enables my team to solve challenging and interesting problems.With over 10 years of experience in building and leading data & ML related systems and teams, I am the co-founder and CEO of DAGWorks, a startup that helps data practitioners with a powerful and flexible framework based on Hamilton, an open source project that I co-created.

    Something that made my day last Friday was discovering this recommendation (see image) from a user on Reddit, Inc. about hashtag#Burr ü§Ø.

    The thread is a great read in general for those building in the LLM space. I think it hits the nail on the head with the current problems people face with the incumbent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc). 

    It's our thesis at DAGWorks Inc. that hashtag#productionization matters, and if you don't design for it from the beginning you're going to be up üí© creek without a paddle very soon. That's why we think both hashtag#Hamilton and hashtag#Burr offer excellent experiences here and you should start with them from the beginning! It'll save you a lot trouble down the line, and without sacrificing your development speed.

    Please tag someone who is productionizing work / send them this thread -- we'd love to make them ship faster with more confidence.

Following up from revealing that Elijah ben Izzy and I have started a company last week, I just wanted to mention three things:

(1) We‚Äôre super excited to say that we got into hashtag#ycombinator ! It starts this week! We‚Äôre super pumped for the opportunity to be part of the YC network and have a lot of work ahead of us to reach our goals for demo day.

(2) If you feel it's too costly in time or team size to maintain/manage your hashtag#ML hashtag#ETLs ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to chat with you! Leave me a message in a comment and I‚Äôll reach out, else feel free to sign up via dagworks.io (link in comments).

(3) Getting up to this point has been six plus months in the making, and without the generosity of people‚Äôs time, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get things to where they are today; according to my notes I have spoken to over 115 people! So I have to say a big THANK YOU here üôèüôèüôè. Starting a company is hard, and I‚Äôm grateful for the amazing network that I have that has given me so much opportunity, advice, and feedback. Every conversation has been an education and I‚Äôve been trying to be incrementally better each time. So if you've chatted with me, know that I have a lot of gratitude for the time you gave me; let me know how I can help you, or help someone you know.

Cheers!

    If you want to ship AI software to production, then you have to bring a systematic approach to evaluating it. After getting a bunch of #Burr user questions around this, I wrote a quick blog post on one possible pattern using #pytest - which is a very popular unit testing framework for #python. But, since LLM calls are non-deterministic you have to adjust how you use pytest. In the post I show how you can augment pytest's behavior to enable a test drive development (TDD) approach to iterating on your LLM calls + logic. Also, if you want to learn more around shipping Reliable AI software, sign-up for the course Hugo Bowne-Anderson and I are putting on next week on Maven - link in the comments., Test Driven Development (TDD) of LLM / Agent Applications with pytest, blog.dagworks.io

            TL;DR: Bridging the gap between Data Science/ML & Engineering.

            My team & I get to set product roadmaps, build platforms, infrastructure, tooling, and services for Data Scientists to help with their model development, as well as help them plug that back into the business.
            We want to make it super simple and easy to create, manage, and innovate in the model eco-system; so think "Centralized Featurization", "Model Artifacts", "A/B Testing", "Model Back-testing Framework" etc. Also think "how should we design this integration to plug this algorithm back into the business?", "What are some levers we could build to make it easier for Data Scientists to impact the business?"

            I also believe in good slack emojis, so I spend time to contribute there when I can too.

            Current/Past projects include:
             - designing a python kafka microservice framework (see slides below)
             - product managing, managing cross-functional partners, building, and getting organizational buy-in behind a centralized experimentation framework.
             - enabling better experimentation knobs for styling recommendations.
             - owning the entire hiring pipeline from sourcing, interviewing, and closing candidates for my team.
             - conceptualizing, driving, and managing initial Algorithms wide onboarding education efforts "Algorithms Curriculum".
             - designing APIs for algorithm integrations with the business
             - conceptualizing, product managing, and building a DataFrame creator library for time-series modeling (see Hamilton talk below)
             - conceptualizing, evangelizing, product managing, managing cross-functional partners, and building a framework agnostic ML Platform (see slides below)TL;DR: Bridging the gap between Data Science/ML & Engineering.

            As a data science engineer I get to wear many hats that bridge core engineering, data & machine learning. 

            Specific accomplishments include:
             - successfully oversaw customer project where we scaled their analysis from a few thousand tweets to over four million; had to communicate clear expectations, requirements for model improvement, and shepherding data acquisition and model predictions to meet the client's needs.
             - engineered core ML technologies on top of Spark's Machine Learning libraries, which we extended, to deliver the ability to train models in batch and then deploy them directly to a web-server for very fast single item predictions. (See https://github.com/skrawcz & the project is called idiml)
             - motivating and educating others on modern engineering best practices on projects that I was involved with.

            I have worn and continue to wear many hats at Nextdoor. Everything from product feature engineering, data-analysis & A/B testing, prototyping ML apps, to owning key technologies that provide organizational leverage, to organizing speakers & being the cultural protagonist for change; you could say that I strive to use both sides of my brain.

            Specific accomplishments include:
             - inventing, pitching, and leading the "R3" program. R3 stands for Reflect, Reinvent, Refine. It provides a few days where the whole company got to innovate by doing "R3". It is still run to this day (they ran one in 2021)!
             - building libraries for structured logging & event tracking to provide hooks to capture data
             - owning & architecting the event tracking pipeline
             - helping & educating colleagues on how to leverage the data being captured
             - building out a first version ETL pipeline & subsequently helping out improve & maintain our 2.0 version
             - shepherding client side tracking through to replace mixpanel
             - evangelizing how to A/B test & setup experiments (e.g. on the growth team & in general)
             - owning & architecting the library that enables Nextdoor to roll out and ramp features
             - being an open source contributor, by contributing to Apache Flume.

        See patent
            An action is performed in a spoken dialog system in response to a user's spoken utterance. A policy which maps belief states of user intent to actions is retrieved or created. A belief state is determined based on the spoken utterance, and an action is selected based on the determined belief state and the policy. The action is performed, and in one embodiment, involves requesting clarification of the spoken utterance from the user. Creating a policy may involve simulating user inputs and spoken dialog system interactions, and modifying policy parameters iteratively until a policy threshold is satisfied. In one embodiment, a belief state is determined by converting the spoken utterance into text, assigning the text to one or more dialog slots associated with nodes in a probabilistic ontology tree (POT), and determining a joint probability based on probability distribution tables in the POT and on the dialog slot assignments.An action is performed in a spoken dialog system in response to a user's spoken utterance.
